The **Birthday Paradox** is a famous probability problem that reveals a counterintuitive result:

**In a group of just 23 people, there is a greater than 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday.**

### **Why is it Surprising?**

- Since there are **365 days in a year**, most people assume that you need **a much larger group** (closer to 365) for a shared birthday to become likely.
- However, the probability increases rapidly due to the **number of possible pairs** in the group.

---

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**

Instead of calculating the probability that **at least two people share a birthday**, itâ€™s easier to first calculate the **probability that no one shares a birthday** and subtract it from 1.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Probability That No One Shares a Birthday**

- The first person can have **any** birthday â†’ **100% probability (365/365).**
- The second person must have a **different** birthday â†’ **364/365.**
- The third person must also have a different birthday from the first two â†’ **363/365.**
- The fourth person must also have a different birthday â†’ **362/365.**
- This continues for **n** people.

So, the probability that **all** \( n \) people have different birthdays is:

\[
P(\text{No shared birthday}) = \frac{365}{365} \times \frac{364}{365} \times \frac{363}{365} \times \dots \times \frac{(365 - n + 1)}{365}
\]

### **Step 2: Compute the Probability That at Least Two People Share a Birthday**

Since we are interested in the opposite case (at least one shared birthday), we subtract the above probability from 1:

\[
P(\text{At least one shared birthday}) = 1 - P(\text{No shared birthday})
\]

## **Why Does It Reach 50% at Just 23 People?**

- As the number of people increases, the number of **possible birthday comparisons (pairs of people)** grows **quadratically**.
- The number of unique **pairs** in a group of **n** people is:

  \[
  \text{Pairs} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
  \]

  For **23 people**, this is:

  \[
  \frac{23(22)}{2} = 253 \text{ pairs}
  \]

  Since we are checking **253 pairs** for a possible birthday match, the probability of at least one match grows rapidly.

## **Some Key Probability Values**

| People | Probability of Shared Birthday |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 5      | 2.7%                           |
| 10     | 11.7%                          |
| 20     | 41.1%                          |
| **23** | **50.7%** (crosses 50%)        |
| 30     | 70.6%                          |
| 40     | 89.1%                          |
| 50     | 97%                            |
| 57     | 99%                            |

By **57 people**, the probability is over **99%**, meaning itâ€™s almost certain that at least two people will share a birthday.

## **Intuition Behind the Paradox**

1. **Exponential Growth of Pairs:**
   - Even though there are only **365 possible birthdays**, the number of **comparisons (pairs of people)** grows **quadratically** with group size.
2. **Comparing All Pairs, Not Just to a Fixed Day:**
   - If we were asking, "What is the probability that someone shares **your** birthday?" it would be much lower.
   - But we are asking about **any** two people sharing a birthday, which involves many more comparisons.

---

## **Conclusion**

- The **Birthday Paradox** is a great example of how human intuition about probability can be misleading.
- Even with just **23 people**, the probability of a shared birthday is **greater than 50%**.
- This principle is used in **cryptography (Birthday Attack on hash functions)** and other fields where **collision probabilities** matter.

### **The Birthday Paradox: A Detailed Explanation**

The **Birthday Paradox** is a probability problem that highlights an unintuitive fact:

> **In a group of just 23 people, there is a greater than 50% chance that at least two of them share the same birthday.**

This is surprising because there are **365 days in a year**, and most people expect that you'd need **closer to 365 people** to get a high probability of a shared birthday. However, the probability increases much faster than we intuitively expect due to **combinatorial explosion**â€”the number of possible **pairs of people** grows much faster than the number of people.

---

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**

Instead of directly calculating the probability that at least two people share a birthday, we use the **complement principle**:

\[
P(\text{At least one shared birthday}) = 1 - P(\text{No shared birthdays})
\]

This approach simplifies calculations because it is much easier to compute the probability that **no one shares a birthday** than to compute the probability that **at least one pair does**.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the Probability That No One Shares a Birthday**

We assume the following:

- There are **365 days in a year**.
- Each personâ€™s birthday is equally likely to fall on any of those days.
- We ignore leap years.

If we add people **one by one** to a group, the first person can have any birthday (**100% probability**). The second person must have a birthday **different from the first person**, the third person must have a birthday **different from the first two**, and so on.

#### **Probability Calculation**

1. **The first person** can have any birthday:  
   \[
   P_1 = 365/365 = 1.000
   \]

2. **The second person** must have a birthday different from the first:  
   \[
   P_2 = 364/365 \approx 0.997
   \]

3. **The third person** must have a birthday different from the first two:  
   \[
   P_3 = 363/365 \approx 0.994
   \]

4. **The fourth person** must have a birthday different from the first three:  
   \[
   P_4 = 362/365 \approx 0.991
   \]

This pattern continues for **n** people, leading to the general formula:

\[
P(\text{No shared birthday}) = \frac{365}{365} \times \frac{364}{365} \times \frac{363}{365} \times \dots \times \frac{(365 - n + 1)}{365}
\]

For a group of **23 people**, this probability calculates to **0.4927 (49.27%)**.

Using the complement rule:

\[
P(\text{At least one shared birthday}) = 1 - 0.4927 = 0.5073 = 50.73\%
\]

Thus, for just **23 people**, the probability that **at least two of them share a birthday is greater than 50%**.

---

### **Step 2: Why Does the Probability Increase So Fast?**

The key reason the probability increases so quickly is that we are not just comparing each person to a single day (e.g., asking, "What is the probability that someone shares **your** birthday?"). Instead, we are comparing **every person to every other person** in the group.

The number of possible **pairs of people** grows **quadratically**:

\[
\text{Number of pairs} = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}
\]

For **23 people**, this means:

\[
\frac{23(22)}{2} = 253 \text{ pairs}
\]

Each of these 253 pairs has a chance of sharing a birthday, and since this number grows rapidly, the probability of at least one match rises **much faster than expected**.

---

### **Step 3: Probability Values for Different Group Sizes**

Hereâ€™s how the probability changes as we increase the group size:

| Number of People | Probability of At Least One Shared Birthday |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 5                | 2.7%                                        |
| 10               | 11.7%                                       |
| 15               | 25.3%                                       |
| 20               | 41.1%                                       |
| **23**           | **50.7%** (crosses 50%)                     |
| 30               | 70.6%                                       |
| 40               | 89.1%                                       |
| 50               | 97.0%                                       |
| 57               | 99.0%                                       |

By **57 people**, the probability is over **99%**, meaning it is almost certain that at least two people will share a birthday.

---

## **Step 4: Intuition Behind the Paradox**

1. **Exponential Growth of Pairs**

   - The number of comparisons grows **quadratically** as the group size increases.
   - While there are only **365 possible birthdays**, the number of pairs checking for shared birthdays grows much faster.

2. **Comparing Pairs vs. Comparing to a Fixed Day**
   - If we were only checking **if someone shares your birthday**, the probability would be much lower.
   - But we are checking if **any** two people share a birthday, which leads to much **higher probabilities**.

---

## **Step 5: Real-World Applications of the Birthday Paradox**

### **1. Cryptography â€“ The Birthday Attack**

The Birthday Paradox is used in **hash function attacks** in cryptography:

- In a hash function, the goal is to avoid collisions (two different inputs producing the same hash).
- The Birthday Paradox shows that **collisions happen much sooner than expected**.
- For a **hash function with N possible outputs**, a collision is expected after roughly **âˆšN** inputs instead of N.

Example:

- A **128-bit hash function** has **\(2^{128}\)** possible outputs.
- You might think you need **\(2^{128}\)** inputs to expect a collision.
- But by the Birthday Paradox, you actually only need about **\(2^{64}\)** inputs.

This is called the **Birthday Attack** and is used to weaken cryptographic security.

---

## **Step 6: Simulation Using Python**

Would you like to run a Python simulation to visualize the Birthday Paradox in action? Here's a quick implementation:

```python
import random

def birthday_simulation(num_people, trials=10000):
    count_shared = 0

    for _ in range(trials):
        birthdays = [random.randint(1, 365) for _ in range(num_people)]
        if len(birthdays) != len(set(birthdays)):  # If duplicates exist
            count_shared += 1

    probability = count_shared / trials
    return probability

# Run simulation for 23 people
num_people = 23
prob = birthday_simulation(num_people)
print(f"Probability of at least one shared birthday in a group of {num_people}: {prob:.4f}")
```

This will approximate the 50.7% probability using random simulations.

---

## **Conclusion**

- The **Birthday Paradox** is a great example of how our intuition about probability can be misleading.
- Due to the **exponential growth of pairs**, the probability of a shared birthday increases rapidly.
- Even with just **23 people**, the probability crosses **50%**.
- This principle is crucial in **cryptography (Birthday Attack)** and other fields where **collision probabilities** matter.
